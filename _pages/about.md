# About Me {#about-me}
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience at Peking University, expecting to graduate in June 2026. I received my B.S. in Cognitive Psychology from Peking University in 2020 and subsequently entered the doctoral program under the supervision of Prof. Fang Fang.  
My current research centers on two main domains:  
1. Visual learning and plasticity, with a particular focus on wakeful consolidation and modulation (tDCS, repetitive visual stimulations)  
2. Visual spatial attention, including visual search, multiple object tracking, and neuromodulation (HD-tDCS, tACS)    
 
To address these topics, I employ a multimodal methodological approach encompassing fMRI, MRS, EEG/MEG, pupillometry, psychophysics, transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), and computational modeling.

# Portfolio (Selected Unpublished Work) {#portfolio}
## Frequency-dependent photic modulation of wakeful consolidation
> In this study, we found that 10-Hz repetitive visual stimulation after training on an orientation discrimination task facilitated wakeful consolidation, accompanied by augmented early visual potentials and increased visual cortical excitation, supportive of the potentiation hypothesis. By simulating Hebbian plasticity (i.e., potentiation) in a minimalistic recurrent network model of the human visual cortex, behavioral and neurochemical results were quantatatively replicated.

## Causal contribution of the right superior parietal lobule to mental effort in shaping multiple object tracking performance
> In this study, we showed that increasing objective tracking load increased pupil size (subjective mental effort), mediated by increased BOLD responses in the right superior parietal lobule (rSPL). Anodal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (a-HD-tDCS) over rSPL increased tracking accuracy, mediated by increased the pupil size during tracking. By combining HD-tDCS and mediation analyses, we identified a causal role of rSPL in mental effort shaping visual tracking performance.
